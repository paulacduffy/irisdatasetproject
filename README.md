The Iris Flower Dataset was introduced by Ronald Fischer in his 1936 paper *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems*. It is a multivariate dataset, which means that it contains two or more variable quantities. It contains the following data on 50 samples from each of three varieties of the Iris flower: Sepal Length (cm), Sepal Width (cm), Petal Length (cm), Petal Width (cm) and Class (Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour and Iris Virginica. 
(Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)
The sepal is the outer part of the flower that encloses a developing bud (often green in colour) and the petal is the coloured part of the flower. (Reference: https://www.amnh.org/learn/biodiversity_counts/ident_help/Parts_Plants/parts_of_flower.htm)

I figured out today that it is necessary to use libraries to manipulate the data as required. I imported pandas & numpy and used pandas to import the dataset and give titles to the columns.
