The Iris Flower Dataset was introduced by Ronald Fischer in his 1936 paper *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems*. It is a multivariate dataset, which means that it contains two or more variable quantities. It contains the following data on 50 samples from each of three varieties of the Iris flower: Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length and Sepal Width, all measured in centimetres.
